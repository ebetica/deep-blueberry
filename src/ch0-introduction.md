# Deep Blueberry Book!

A curated collection of free places where you can learn about deep-learning. If you've
always wanted to learn about deep-learning but don't know where to start, you might have
stumbled upon the right place!

This self-learning curriculum is an introduction to deep learning methods with applications.
It's split into five modules, designed to be completed in five weekends. Each module takes
about 8+ hours, you might be inspired to go above and beyond the material. Per module,
you might want to take three hours to digest the theory and test your understanding plus
five hours to tinker with the provided code.

## Modules
