This self-learning curriculum is an introduction to deep learning methods with applications.
It's split into five modules and designed to be completed in five weekends. Each module takes
about 8+ hours, you might be inspired to go above and beyond the material. Per module,
you might want to take about three hours to digest the theory (_and test your understanding_)
plus an additional five hours to experiment with available code.
