### Code exercises: [Pytorch Tutorials][c1] | [Keras Tutorials][c2]

This self-learning curriculum is an introduction to deep learning methods with applications.
It's split into five modules, designed to be completed in five weekends. Each module takes
about 8+ hours, you might be inspired to go above and beyond the material. Per module,
you might want to take three hours to digest the theory and test your understanding plus
five hours to tinker with the availabe code.
